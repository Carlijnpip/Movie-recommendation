# Movie-recommendation
My plan for this project is to create a movie recommendation system which recommends movies to users based on their preferences. First the user answers some questions about their preferences, after which the system filters and suggests movie options. These questions could for example be about the preferred genre, decade and the length. 
For this project I will need Pandas to analyze the data and Numpy for calculations. In the case that I would want to plot a graph showing the compatibility with movies based on the users preferences I would also need to use matplotlib.
To provide fitting recommendations I need a dataset consisting of a number of movies and their characteristics, such as for example length and genre. For this the IMDb top 100 could be used.
The output of the system would be a short list of movies that align the most with the userâ€™s preferences. An option is to also show a graph which illustrates which movies fit best on a 0-100% scale.
